    // OOP - Object Oriented Programming
    // Procedural Programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform
    // operations on the data, while OOP is about creating objects that contain both
    // data and methods.

    // Advantages of OOP than POP
    // > OOP is fatser and easier to execute
    // > OOP provides a clear structure for programs
    // > OOPS helps to keep the java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself" and makes the
    // code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
    // > OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code
    // and shorter development time
