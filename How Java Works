How Java Exactly Works

Source Code or (.java file) 
=> javac compiler => ByteCode or (.class file)
=> JVM (Java Virtual machine) 
=> Output

What Happens at Runtime?

class file
-> ClassLoader 
-> ByteCode Verifier
-> Interpreter 
-> Runtime
-> Hardwware

ClassLoader: It is the subsystem of JVM that is used to load the class file .

ByteCode Verifier: It verifies the code blocks for illegal code that can violate access right to objects.

Interpreter: Reads ByteCode and then execute the instructions line by line.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

1. JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine is an abstract machine.
2. It is called a virtual machine bcoz it doesn't physically.
3. It is the specification that provides a Runtime Environment in which 
   java bytecode which can be executed.
4. It can also run those programs which are written in other lanngugaes and 
   compiled to Java bytecode.
5. JVMs are available for many hardware and softeare.
6. JVM, JRE and JDK are platform dependent bcoz the configuration of each OS is 
   different from each other but Java is a platform independent.
